            <p>Hello. My name is Edi Carlos da Silva. I like to say just Edi Carlos. The
                pronunciation
                is like Édi Carlos. I live in Votorantim, Brazil. I am marriage and I have four
                children, one is already in heaven. I am not a member of the church yet. I am
                working on
                it. I work as teach and recently I got the opportunity to work as Developer Analyst
                too.
                I think BYU and this course I am running helped with that. I do believe that
                Heavenly
                Father gave me this opportunity too. In my job as software Analyst I work with .Net
                Technologies and and do fullstack tasks. I use git, AzureDevOps, Visual Studio IDE,
                C#,
                ASP.Net Web Forms, DevExpress, SQL Server, Entity Framework. This is the stack I use
                and
                I am working to improve in the knowledge.
                I work to get update in new Technologies too, like typescript, nodejs, and others.
                Before I study these Technologies I let everything ok from the assignments from this
                BYU
                course. I am super happy doing these courses and learning by the way of BYU and the
                instructors I know along the way.</p>

            <p>I live in Brazil. Brazil is a beautiful and big country. Brazil, officially the
                Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in South America. It is
                also the world's fifth-largest country by area and the seventh-largest by
                population,
                with over 213
                million people. The country is a federation composed of 26 states and a Federal
                District, which
                hosts the capital, Brasília. Its most populous city is São Paulo (the state that I
                live), followed
                by Rio de Janeiro (the picture is from Rio de Janeiro city). Brazil has the most
                Portuguese speakers in the world and is the only country in the Americas where
                Portuguese is an official language.</p>
